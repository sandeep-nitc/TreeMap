1. Run the program through Command prompt by typing this command -> javac RedBlackTree.java -> java RedBlackTree
2. Then you will asked to provide initial size of TreeMap must be Integer Value
3. Then you will asked to select options i.e 1) PUT<Key,Value> 2) Get<Key> 3) Print 4) Exit.

NOTE :- 

1) initial size is the number of elements are allowed to add in the TreeMap, when we exceeds the initial size by adding element 
   then automatically all the element in the TreeMap are moved to " Key_VALUE.txt " file and then new element added to the TreeMap

2) Put and Get method are thread safe as we have used synchronized keyword so that only one thread allow to access these method 
   at a time.

3)
